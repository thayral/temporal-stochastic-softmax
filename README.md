This code is intended to help integrating stochastic softmax with other models.
The dataset object maintains a list of explorated clips (`afew.py`).
The training loop updates the temporal score distribution of each video example (`trainer.py`). These distributions are used by the datasampler (`afew.py`) to select clips efficiently. Multiprocessing and files are used to handle communication between the dataloader and the training loop (synchronize training steps, sampling strategy, temporal distributions, etc.).



### Inflated 3D CNNs
This project also contains the code for inflating the 2D model to 3D CNN.
Examples of 2D pretrained vgg model: 
https://github.com/XiaoYee/emotion_classification
https://github.com/prabhuiitdhn/Emotion-detection-VGGnet-architecture-fer2013

2D models can be inflated with inflate.py to build and save a 3D model as vgg_3d.pth to then be finetuned.


#### Videotransforms
Videotransforms are PyTorch tensor transforms provided by [Yana Hasson](https://github.com/hassony2/torch_videovision) for consistent data augment in videos.
